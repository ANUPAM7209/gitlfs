# weekly step analysis

This document provides an analysis of the number of steps I walked each day for a week. Goal is to identify patterns and gain insights into my activity level.

## Methodology

1. **Data Collection**:
    Steps were tracked using a fitness tracker app over 7 days.

2. **Comparison**
   - **Self**: Steps were compared  day-to-day to observe trends.
   - **Friends**: Data was shared with friends to see how I performed against them.

3. **Analysis Tools**:
    The analysis was performed using the following tools;

    - Microsoft Excel for data visualization.
    - Python for statistical claculation.
      Example python snippent:

      ```Python
      import statistics
      steps = [8000, 9000, 7200, 10000, 8700, 9000, 11000]
      avg_steps = statistics.mean(steps)
      print(f"Avg steps: {avg_steps}")
      ```

    - Inline code example: `statistics.mean()` was used to calculate the average steps.
